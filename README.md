## iris-plant-classification
# Background Problem
In this project, I aimed to classify Iris plant species using machine learning. The problem lies in accurately distinguishing between Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their sepal and petal dimensions. Misclassification can affect botanical research, automated plant identification, and precision agriculture.

Situation: The dataset contains various measurements of Iris flowers, and the challenge is to build a model that can accurately classify them.

Task: The goal is to develop a Machine Learning model using Random Forest to classify Iris species with high accuracy. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
